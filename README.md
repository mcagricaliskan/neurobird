I coded clone of the flappy bird

I had to code neural network from scratch. Because my computer not good enough for creating bigger population with using deep learning libraries and it worked i create 300 simple neural network (just forward propagation and making prediction).

I think code is fine and not messy. I will add some comment lines later.

Sometimes I found best population so fast. I saw best generation on third cycle (I guess it was a very easy problem to solve for a nn).

just a sample here 16th generation
